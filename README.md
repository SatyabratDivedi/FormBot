"I am currently developing a full-stack form bot website using the MERN stack. My goal is to replace an old Google Form with a new-generation talking chatbot. This bot is fully secure,
as I am storing hashed passwords in the backend MongoDB using bcrypt. The tech stack includes React, Express, and MongoDB, with Redux for state management.
The bot allows interaction with users through images and videos, and once a user submits the form through the bot, the responses are displayed on a dashboard."
