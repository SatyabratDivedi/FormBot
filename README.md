I created a full-stack form bot website using the MERN stack to replace an old Google Form with a new-generation talking chatbot. It is fully secure, as I am storing hashed passwords in the backend using bcrypt and MongoDB. The technologies I used include React, Express, MongoDB, and Redux for state management.

⭕ Main Features:

👉🏻Admin can update and delete the bot which he create.
<br>
👉🏻This bot allows users to create and interact with a chatbot that supports both images and videos.
<br>
👉🏻When a user submits a form through the chatbot, the responses are displayed in a response dashboard, where the admin can see all responses.
